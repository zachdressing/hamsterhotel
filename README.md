//Hamster Hotel, I made a website based on the prototype with my own responsiveness

//Peer Reivew by Aiden Foo: Overall, the website looks pretty close to the prototype with little thinkgs here and there such as the Room's background ending at the cards and not a little further down the page like on the prototype. 
//In terms of responsiveness, the wesite acts well in accordance to the screen size except for the reserve hamster image that reappears after I shrank the screen size below a threshold and clips into the footer. Easy fixes, good job overall.
